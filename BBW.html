								</header>
                                <h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>I am a bit late to publish this report as Q4 2020 numbers have already been reported, and the current price is not as compelling as when I personally purchased; however I think there is still upside of approximately 20+%. This report is inspired by GME which was a physical retailer that was overshorted despite the fact that its balance sheet was in relatively healthy position, it still provided value to customers that preferred physical game copies or lacked bandwidth to download games, and it offered value to online IP partners as evidenced by the deal signed in October 2020 in which Microsoft gives GME a commission on all downstream revenues generated on Xbox consoles sold by GME. Likewise, Build-a-Bear Workshop is a retailer that has had declining revenues for a few years but still offers customers experiences that are not conducive to being entirely moved online (the experience of building and customizing plush toys by hand), has manageable levels of long-term debt on the balance sheet (in the form of leases), has recovered incredibly quickly from COVID-19, and has a wide range of deals with IP providers to sell exclusive types of toys online. BBW's operations were significantly hampered in H1 2020 due to store closures, but H2 2020 saw BBW continue a recovery that had started in 2019 with net income of $10.50 million in H2 2020 and FCF of $9 million for the year. If investors believe children will continue to enjoy making teddy bears and that H2 2020 results are indicative at all of future performance, then applying a 10-20x PE multiple to H2 2020 earnings derives a market cap of $105-$210 million, compared to the current market cap of $132 million as of 3/14/2021. Though it is hard to predict what exactly the future sales and income figures will be given the sensitivity to COVID store closures, I believe a PE ratio of 20 can easily be justified by the fact that COVID strengthens BBW as it reduces store leasing costs and current leases are flexible, there are is little debt to be managed, revenues were recovering starting in 2019, and BBW has already established profitable online sales channels.</p>
                                <h3>Company Background</h3>
                                <p>Build-a-Bear Workshop is a retailer that provides customized teddy bears/plush dolls through physical retail locations and now increasingly through web channels. BBW differentiates from traditional toy retailers by offering customers the ability to customize their own bear creations by choosing outfits, names, and even creating the bears by hand in stores. The dolls include licensed IP (Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Harry Potter, etc.) and also BBW's own designed products. The company segregates its operations into the following three segments:                               </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>"Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) – Corporately-managed retail stores located in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.K., Ireland, Denmark and China and two e-commerce sites."                                    </li>
                                    <li>Commercial – Wholesale product sales and licensing of brand and IP to third parties that execute the BBW experience at locations such as cruise ships, sporting events, etc. </li>
                                    <li>"International franchising – Royalties as well as product and fixture sales from other international operations under franchise agreements."</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>From a cursory look at BBW's income statement, we can see that BBW has suffered like many physical retailers and operations have not been smooth over the past 5 years. Total revenues are down over 10% from 2015-2019 (excluding 2020 due to COVID effects), and BBW has fluctuated between profitability and losses.</p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/BBW1.png'>
                                </div>
                                <p>However there are some important things to notice:                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>2019 was a recovery year in that it was the first year since 2014 with positive revenue growth, and this growth was partially led by increases in license/contract fee revenue. This revenue is related to third parties licensing the BBW brand to hold host pop-up stores at special events. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The recovery continued in H2 2020 despite still having COVID-related store closures. Revenues were down just 3.81% YOY and gross profit margins reached a relative high at over 48%.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>I believe the FY 2019 and H2 2020 figures show that BBW has reached a reflection point through necessary restructurings, such as closing less profitable international stores, shifting to smaller stores in areas other than shopping malls, and renegotiating lease terms, and BBW has also sufficiently developed its brand to take advantage of other revenue channels such as licensing revenue and online sales. The current structure should allow BBW to be more consistently profitable in the future and also grow revenues through new channels.
                                </p>
                                <h3>BBW Operational Analysis: </h3>
                                <p>One of the factors slightly concealing the potential behind BBW is the fact that management does not particularly stress the geographical segments. For corporate owned stores, the North American and the European/Chinese segments have very significant performance differences. As seen below, stores operated in North America have increased over the past 5 years while stores in Europe/China have decreased, and in addition, revenues per store have decreased at a much higher rate in Europe/China than North America. Finally, though profitability per store has decreased for both markets, the Europe/China markets have actually had negative "store contribution"* the past two full years while North America has remained profitable.
                                </p>
                                <p><i>*"Store contribution" is a non-GAAP figure that BBW reports on its financial statements, and it is roughly equivalent to operational income generated by stores in each market. 
                                </i>   </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/BBW2.png'>
                                </div>
                                <p>This conceals the fact that while the European/Chinese operations have struggled, the North American operations have been relatively much more stable. There is thus more value in the North American segment than if the entire segment was considered in whole, and management may consider spinning off or discontinuing international operations (latest Q4 2020 results show 7 out of 56 international stores were closed last year). In addition, management has stressed some strategic store decisions in the North American markets such as shifting to smaller stores and opening 22 stores inside Walmart locations over the past two years, and similar approaches in international markets may yield results. The fact that revenue per store was once higher in Europe/China suggests that there is potential for a similar recovery in these markets and that the brand and offering have value. 
                                </p>
                                <p>BBW has not historically provided information about its online sales since it is mainly an experiential retailer; however, it disclosed during the Q4 2020 earnings announcement that online sales have increased over 100% year-over-year in the quarter, and simultaneously that there was an 18% reduction in store operating days due to COVID. This signifies that BBW is capable of generating sales through its online channels, and that its exclusive and licensed IP such as Pokemon, Star Wars, and Animal Crossing products are actually capable gaining customer attention online. Furthermore BBW's offering lends itself to recurring revenues better than traditional retailers or other toy makers as it offers a range of products such as clothing, voice messages, and accessories that specifically fit their plush toys. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Regarding liquidity, BBW has sufficient cash and levels of debt that should allow it to both survive any short term COVID-related shocks and also grow after re-openings. BBW only has debt in the form of operating lease liabilities, and with $34.8 million in cash against $32.4 million in current lease obligations, BBW should be solvent for the short term. In addition, BBW has actually managed to improve some of its liquidity position over the past 5 years as seen by the quick ratio and cash ratios. This improvement has been accomplished by cutting capex in 2020, holding less inventories, and signing shorter leases. 
                                </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/BBW3.png'>
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/BBW4.png'>
                                </div>
                                <p>BBW's previous strategy of signing short-term lease agreements and its role as an experiential retailer also give it flexibility after the pandemic. Over 70% of BBW's leased corporate stores have lease events over the next three years, and management has increasingly been utilizing percent of sales leases rather than fixed leases. As seen by Chinese mall footfall data, even after China has largely recovered from COVID, foot traffic is still only around 80% of previous levels. Thus lease flexibility is of paramount importance. 
                                </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/BBW5.jpg'>
                                </div>
                                <p>In addition, BBW is a store that targets children but also typically brings traffic in the form of parents and offers family experiences rather than simple purchasing options. This should give BBW increased leverage in leasing negotiations.
                                </p>
                                <p>With enough cash and liquidity to purse any strategic initiatives, a profitable core business in North America, a brand that earns IP partners such as Pixar and Disney, online channels that are already proven to be successful, and return of revenues from store re-openings and license fees, BBW is well positioned to continue earnings growth. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Valuation:</h3>
                                <p>Rather than predict revenues and expenses which may vary wildly with COVID and popular film release dates (this drives plush toy demand), I will use multiples/relative valuation.The peer group I constructed is of many specialty retailers in the U.S,toymakers, and toy retailers. The peer group largely has higher market caps and EV than BBW since it is difficult to construct a peer group of representative small/microcap stocks. However many of them are traditional retailers that do have any experiential offerings or developed online channels like BBW. 
                                </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/BBW6.jpg'>
                                </div>
                                <p>Nonetheless, by most metrics BBW trades at a discount to peers by at least 20% as seen above. I believe applying the simple valuation format posed in the introduction, 10-20x PE multiple to H2 2020 earnings to derive a market cap of $105-$210 million, may actually be reasonable and shows the risk-return trade off with BBW. At a multiple as low as 10x half year earnings, we are only facing ~30% discount from market price and at 20x half year earnings we have potential ~60% upside. 
                                </p>
