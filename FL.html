									Foot Locker</h2>

								</header>
                                <h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The buy thesis for Footlocker (FL) can be summarized most succinctly with the help of two pictures. </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/fl1.JPG'>
                                    <p></p>
                                </div>
                                <p>The first shows that Footlocker's topline and bottom line results the past decade have not only been "not that bad" but have actually been pretty good. From 2011-2019 the company consistently grew revenues at 4.55% CAGR and margin improvement led to EPS growing 12.51% CAGR. Meanwhile, the second figure shows the market's perceptions about Footlocker: that it is a distressed retailer that is being driven out of business by the rise of online retail and the collapse of mall traffic. 
                                </p>
                                <p>So despite the fact that Footlocker has remained profitable every year of the last decade and achieved all-time high TTM earnings of $8.10 (the current stock price is just $42), Foot Locker stock has lagged and even trailed other retail peers. Footlocker currently trades at 9.40x 2019 diluted EPS and 5.21x TTM diluted EPS. Reversion to mean multiples of retailers in its peer group represent possible upside of near 40%, and based on FL's operating metrics, I believe it is deserving of a premium multiple. Possible catalysts that can help FL realize "fair value" may be continued share repurchases in addition to re-raising the dividend given that Foot Locker has sufficient cash balances and most of the industry shock from COVID are likely over. </p>

                                <h3>Company Background</h3>
                                <p>Footlocker is a simple business, it operates as primarily a physical retailer and deals in sneakers, basketball shoes, clothing, and sporting equipment primarily through its Footlocker and Champs Sports brands. The Champs Sports brand is solely located in North America, while the Foot Locker brand is found across the globe. </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/fl2.JPG'>
                                    <p></p>
                                </div>
                                <p>As of 1/30/2021, Footlocker had 2,998 company-operated stores and 127 franchised stores located in the Middle East. Since 2015, the total number of stores has decreased every year despite increasing total sales, and the capital expenditures have averaged approximately $200 million per year in the form of maintenance expenditures and store closure/remodeling costs. </p>
                                <p>The company's online sales were still in development at the onset of the pandemic, total online sales numbered $1.22 and $1.28 billion respectively in FY 2018 and 2019, or 15.4% and 16.1% of Foot Locker's total sales. However, online sales increased to $2.10 billion in FY 2020 or 27.8% of total sales. </p>
                                <p>Regarding products, footwear makes up 83-84% of total sales, and while Foot Locker does have some self-branded products, it primarily relies on third party brands and suppliers. In FY 2020, Foot Locker's top 5 suppliers made up 91% of total sales, with Nike itself contributing 75% of total sales. Footlocker is thus extremely exposed to these brands who may wish to develop their own direct-to-consumer channels and thus present margin pressure for Foot Locker. 
                                </p>
                                <p>However, the exposure to Nike's supply is not a new development for Foot Locker, and it has managed to expand margins and increase revenues the past ten years despite this reliance. Partly of the success is that physical retail has obviously not been in favor, yet Footlocker has an established brand and channel in this industry. Manufacturers like Nike may be less willing to establish their own stores in their own direct-to-consumer channels given the large investment and risk required. In addition, sneakers and the culture surrounding them as status symbols and collectibles has been en vogue in recent years; thus even if online sales or manufacturers' DTC sales make up a larger proportion of sales, the entire industry has been healthily growing. </p>

                                <h3>FL Financial Analysis</h3>
                                <p>Because of its simple business and because it does not have debt (store leases aside) or large minority investments, analyzing Foot Locker and finding the current market mispricing is quite simple. Over the past five financial years, Foot Locker has averaged net income of $460 million ($495 million excluding COVID-impacted 2020) and free cash flow to equity of $624 million. Capital expenditures decreased from $266 million in 2016 to just $187 million in 2019 and $159 million in 2020. Applying 10x PE multiple to the average earnings from 2015-2019 already represents a 10% premium to the current stock price. 
                                </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/fl3.jpg'>
                                </div>
                                <p>In 2020, sales and net income dipped as a result of pandemic-related store closures; however Foot Locker remained profitable and actually generated $903 million in free cash flow without relying on debt-financing. Cash balances at January 30, 2021 were over $1.60 billion while the company's market cap was approximately $6 billion at the time. </p>
                                <p>However 2021 was a significant year in that the company fully recovered from any covid-related sales weakness and increased its capital expenditures with 2 large acquisitions in 2021 Q3. First net income through just the first 3 quarters of 2021 totaled $790 million, higher than any full year in history. In addition, Foot locker acquired WSS and Atmos for $1.11 billion in cash. Atmos expands Foot Locker's online sales capabilities and increases the company's footprint in Asia. WSS gives Foot Locker more stores primarily located in the West Coast of the United States. Management has stated that these two acquisitions will be accretive to 2021 earnings, and despite the large capital outlays, Foot Locker still had over $1.30 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of 2021 Q3 despite its current market cap of approximately $4.5 billon and lack of debt. Neither WSS or Atmos were publicly traded so there is a lack of information available, but I believe they are not incredibly important to this thesis since Foot Locker is so mispriced. </p>
                                
                                <h3>Relative Valuation</h3>
                                <p>While 2021 was a significant year for Foot Locker, it is not unique as many retailers experienced similar surges in demand the past two years. Thus many retailers are trading at very low TTM PE multiples as the market predicts that 2021 is a local maximum for most retail products. It's therefore helpful to view PE against TTM earnings, 2020 and 2019 earnings to get a better understanding of valuations against "normal" years and COVID-impacted years. 
                                </p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/fl4.jpg'>
                                </div>
                                <p>In a peer group of sporting goods third party retailers such as DKS, ASO, VSTO, BOOT, and CWH and branded mall retailers such as ANF and GPS, we see that FL has the nearly the lowest price multiple in each category. 
                                </p>
                                <p>My hypothesis for this underperformance concerns the yellow highlighted cell above which shows that Foot Locker had negative EPS growth in 2020 while other third party retailers had significant EPS growth. This contraction in profits is due to the fact that Foot Locker, like ANF and GPS which also had negative growth, has more exposure to international markets (which had more lockdowns) and higher exposure to mall traffic. These businesses rely more on mall-goers making spontaneous purchase decisions, whereas standalone sporting goods stores rely on predetermined purchase intentions and thus outperformed in the initial stages of the pandemic. However, this caused Foot Locker to trade in-line with distressed mall clothing brands while the retail industry and sporting goods subsector rallied. When Foot Locker began reporting impressive 2021 figures, XRT had already rallied 90% from January 2020 prices and investors already developed apprehension regarding "peak earnings" and placed less emphasis on impressive quarterly numbers. So even though stocks like ANF eventually rallied as it entered the pandemic in a worse financial position and 2021 represented a bigger turnaround, Foot Locker never quite rallied as much because its results were ignored since they were "priced in."</p>
                                <div class="imgbox">
                                    <img class="center-fit" src='images/fl5.png'>
                                </div>
                                <p>Partly I believe Foot Locker is somewhat a victim of its own success; It's easy to see that Foot Locker has a 5.21x TTM PE multiple and believe that Amazon has killed its benefit, it is a debt-riddled company, or that it is a microcap stock that makes tiny profits; however none of that is true. </p>

                                <h3>Catalysts</h3>
                                <p>The underperformance of growth stocks and the rotation torwards value seems to be finally happening in 2022, spurred by the announcement of accelerated Fed tapering plans. This could spur investors to seek out stocks like Foot Locker given that, as we have seen, it is cheap relative to its historical averages and also its peers. In addition, the company does not rely on debt financing and has ample cash flows that will be attractive as investors become more risk averse. </p>
                                <p>In addition, Footlocker completed its 2021 acquisitions using only cash and without outside financing. Nonetheless, it still had over $1 billion in cash as of 2021 Q3, if 2021 Q4 results are also impressive, Footlocker should be sitting on a large cash balance that can be returned to investors in the form of dividends or share buybacks. Dividend yield had reached 6% in 2019, and the company should have enough cash to return to similar yield given the depressed current market valuations. If management is confident that the worst of the pandemic is past, an increase in dividends can help increase share values. </p>
                                <p>Lastly, the market clearly believes that 2021 was peak growth and earnings in the short term. However, Footlocker is still primarily a physical retailer. There is a chance that reopenings and revival of mall traffic lead to sales being elevated for a longer time period than anticipated. I think this is possible given that sneaker demand should be more stable than demand for furniture or other sporting goods, shares of which have rallied since the pandemic, and Foot Locker should be able to at least close the valuation gap in 2022 if not rally itself. </p> 
                                
                                <h3>Risks</h3>
                                <p>The risks for Foot Locker primarily relate to its reliance on Nike as its leading supplier. If Nike begins to push its own DTC channels, Foot Locker will lose its value proposition. In addition, the pandemic accelerated online shopping, which Foot Locker benefited from, but larger retailers such as Amazon or department stores may have scale advantages that give them advantages in this area. </p>
                                <p>However, none of the above risks are anything new; Foot Locker has been reliant on Nike throughout its history and we have been proclaiming the death of physical retail since the early 2000s, and Foot Locker has had impressive results the past 10 years nonetheless. At current prices of 10x 2019 earnings, I think investors are adequately compensated. </p>
