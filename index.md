## Yuyang Eric Zheng


I am a Master of Finance student at the Peking University PHBS Business School in Shenzhen, China, and I am concurrently studying Computational Finance at the Sargent Institute of Quantitative Economics and Finance and expect to graduate in 2021. I also studied Finance at New York University Stern School of Business. My current research thesis concerns gold futures prices and price drivers in different international exchanges and will be available soon. I will also use this site to share research and projects that are of my interest.
